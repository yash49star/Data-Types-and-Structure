Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be modified, added, or removed. This characteristic guarantees that the data stored within a tuple remains constant throughout its lifecycle, preventing accidental or unauthorized changes. Immutability makes tuples suitable for situations where data integrity is paramount, such as storing configuration settings, representing fixed records, or ensuring data consistency in multi-threaded environments."],"metadata":{"id":"AYhojTlsJsel"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q. 8 What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in python?\n","-\n","A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs, where each key is unique and its position in the table is determined by a hash function. This function takes the key as input and produces an index, or \"hash,\" that indicates where the associated value is stored. Hash tables allow for efficient data retrieval, insertion, and deletion, with an average time complexity of O(1).\n","\n","- In Python, dictionaries are implemented using hash tables. When a key-value pair is added to a dictionary, Python calculates the hash value of the key and uses it to determine the position in the underlying hash table where the value will be stored. When a value is retrieved using its key, Python again calculates the hash value of the key and uses it to quickly locate the corresponding value in the hash table. This is why dictionaries in Python provide fast lookups, insertions, and deletions."],"metadata":{"id":"B9Y0S75bKtmh"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q. 9 Can lists contain different data types in python?\n","- Yes, lists can contain different data types such as string, integer, float and boolean in a square brackets."],"metadata":{"id":"Y0ztsyCANFfq"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q. 10 Explain why strings are immutable in python.\n","-\n","In Python, strings are immutable because this design choice offers several benefits:\n","\n","- Efficiency: Since strings cannot be changed after creation, Python can optimize memory allocation and caching. Multiple identical strings can share the same memory location, reducing memory usage.\n","\n","- Thread safety: Immutability makes strings inherently thread-safe. Multiple threads can access and use the same string without the risk of data corruption due to concurrent modification.\n","\n","- Usability as dictionary keys: Immutable objects can be used as keys in dictionaries. If strings were mutable, their hash values could change, making them unsuitable as dictionary keys.\n","\n","- Preventing unintended modification: Immutability ensures that a string's value remains constant throughout its lifetime, preventing accidental or unintended modifications that could lead to bugs."],"metadata":{"id":"h2jkQ1JQOHb2"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q. 11 What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n","-\n","Dictionaries in Python offer several advantages over lists for specific tasks, primarily related to data organization, retrieval, and efficiency. Here's a breakdown of these advantages:\n","\n","1. Efficient Data Retrieval\n","Dictionaries provide fast data retrieval using keys. In a list, to find a specific element, it may require traversing through each item sequentially until the target is found, resulting in O(n) time complexity in the worst case. Dictionaries, on the other hand, use a hash table implementation, allowing for average-case O(1) time complexity for lookups, insertions, and deletions. This means that accessing a value in a dictionary by its key is significantly faster, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n","\n","2. Key-Value Pair Organization\n","Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs, allowing for a more structured and intuitive way to represent relationships between data. This is particularly useful when dealing with data that has a natural association, such as storing user information (e.g., name: \"John\", age: 30, city: \"New York\") or configuration settings. Lists, in contrast, store data in a linear sequence, which may not be suitable for representing such relationships directly.\n","\n","3. Flexibility and Versatility\n","Dictionaries can store values of any data type, and keys can be of any immutable data type (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples). This flexibility makes them suitable for a wide range of applications, including storing complex data structures, representing graphs, or implementing caches. Lists, while also versatile, do not offer the same level of structure and organization as dictionaries.\n","\n","4. Built-in Methods for Manipulation\n","Python dictionaries provide a variety of built-in methods for easy data manipulation, such as get(), keys(), values(), and items(). These methods allow for efficient access, modification, and iteration of data within the dictionary. Lists also have built-in methods, but they are designed for different types of operations, such as sorting, appending, and inserting elements.\n","\n","5. Memory Efficiency\n","Dictionaries are generally memory-efficient, as they only store the key-value pairs that are needed. This can be advantageous when dealing with large datasets, as it can reduce memory consumption compared to lists, which may require pre-allocation of memory.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"AkylHwSNQOjZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q. 12 Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.\n","- Use a list if you need a mutable collection of items where you may need to add, remove, or change elements. Lists are more flexible and have more built-in methods, making them ideal for dynamic collections. Use a tuple if you need an immutable collection where the elements won't change after creation.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"CQZt799rS80l"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q. 13 How do sets handle duplicate values in python?\n","\n","- Sets in Python are designed to store only unique elements. When an attempt is made to add a duplicate value to a set, Python automatically discards the duplicate, ensuring that the set contains only distinct elements. This behavior makes sets useful for tasks like removing duplicates from a list or checking for the presence of an element in a collection.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"LZHxG5kqWghr"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q. 14 How does the \"in\" keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n","- The in keyword checks whether a value exists anywhere in the list.\n","\n","- For Lists (and other sequences like tuples or strings):\n","\n","my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n","\n","print(2 in my_list)      # True → 2 is in the list\n","\n","print(5 in my_list)      # False → 5 is not in the list\n","\n","- For Dictionaries:\n","\n","The in keyword checks only for keys, not values.\n","\n","my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\n","\n","print('a' in my_dict)    # True → 'a' is a key\n","\n","print(1 in my_dict)      # False → 1 is a value, not a key"],"metadata":{"id":"9t5DbSJiW8Xy"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q. 15 Can you modify the elements of a tuple?
